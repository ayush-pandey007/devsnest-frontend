    <p><strong>Dear stan,</strong></p>
    <p>It was enjoyable meeting with you recently and I wanted to send you this letter, As we discussed, <ins>slips & falls</ins> are <br>
    the largest source of injuries to the public and the second largest cause of worker injuries in the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/">United States</a>. Slips & falls <br> inside stores, supermarkets, hotels and <del>workplaces</del> are a very large problem </p>

    <p>Various studies have shown that two-third of all falls can be traced to floor surfaces slip resistance problems Your<br> company has been on our list of well recognized suppliers for over the past fifteen years. Liberty Mutual provides<br> this list to our customers so that they can use proven slip resistance treatments. A number of our clients have used<br> your products and they have dramatically reduced or eliminated slip and fall injuries.</p>

    <p>We appreciate your interest in safety and the prevention of slips  and falls. Besides reducing serious injuries and their<br> related costs, productivity and efficiency are improved when floor surfaces are kept in proper condition.
